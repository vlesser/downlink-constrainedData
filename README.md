# downlink-constrainedData
This project is written in C#. The GUI will input a scenario and blank excel sheet. It will output the downlinked data from the scenario to the excel sheet as well as identifying objects and their relevant information.

This code can be run from the executable or can be modified in Visual Studio. A template excel sheet and scenario will be needed for the code to be run.
